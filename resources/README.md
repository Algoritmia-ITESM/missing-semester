# Resources

This section contains a compilation of learning resources for a large number of
domains of CS, we aim to categorize resources into introductory, intermediate
and advanced contents for each topic, among the resources we list there are
videos, courses, articles, books, documentation, etc.

## Contributing

If you found some resource to be outdated, please upload an issue for it's
evaluation.

If you wish to contribute with resources please read the following guidelines
to do so, then create a pull request with your changes:

- Resources refer to external material on a subject, preferably accessible via
internet. Do not include your personal explanations of a subject or related
content.

- Upload references to resources, such as links or brief instructions on how to
get access to the resource, but do not upload the resources themselves. This is
to prevent issues with copyright, resources becoming updated and bloating the
repository with multimedia contents.

- Avoid listing trivial resources, such as wikipedia pages or official
documentation (on special cases like the offial docs being obscure, or
difficult to obtain, ignore this advice), as their listing can be redundant in
most cases.

- Format resource listing as follows:
```md
### Name [type of resource (example book, course, etc)]

Reference to resource (link or instructions to access it).

Brief description of the subject
