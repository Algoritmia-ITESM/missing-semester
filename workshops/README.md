# Workshops

This section contains workshop notes from our on campus meetings, the workshops
aim to provide an introduction to diverse topics in CS, referencing resources
for further learning them, and providing practice exercises.

If you wish to contribute with a new workshop, please create a pull request with
the workshop notes, and describe in it the aims and plans for the presentation
on campus.

All workshops must comply with the [workshop template](TEMPLATE.md). See the
[clean template](CLEAN_TEMPLATE.md) for a version with all hints and
explanations removed - this is required for workshops.

We may add videos in the future (:
