# Lectures

This section contains lecture notes from our on campus meetings, the lectures
aim to provide an introduction to diverse topics in CS, referencing resources
for further learning them, and providing practice exercises.

If you wish to contribute with a new lecture, please create a pull request with
the lecture notes, and describe in it the aims and plans for the presentation
on campus.

We may add videos in the future (:
